We define super digit of an integer  using the following rules:

If  has only  digit, then its super digit is .
Otherwise, the super digit of  is equal to the super digit of the digit-sum of . Here, digit-sum of a number is defined as the sum of its digits.
For example, super digit of  will be calculated as:
